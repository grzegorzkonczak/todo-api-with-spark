This project is simulation of working together with frontend developer.
My role in this simulation is to provide a working API (using database) for "TODO" simple web application that alredy has developed
frontend using Angular.js.

Project initial files where provided by project idea creators (https://teamtreehouse.com).

Project was meant to follow a set of requirements. Base requirements were as follows:

1. Model stores id, name, and isCompleated (done)
2. Interface provides create, update, delete and the ability to findAll (done)
3. Sql2o DAO implementation implements all methods from the Todo DAO interface and creates the table on initialization (done)
4. GET /api/v1/todos return all todos and populates the web application (done)
5. POST /api/v1/todos creates a new Todo, returns it and sets the appropriate status code (done)
6. PUT /api/v1/todos/xxx is handled and proper Todo is updated (not yet implemented)
7. DELETE /api/v1/todos/xxx deletes the appropriate Todo sends back the appropriate status code and an empty body (not yet implemented)
